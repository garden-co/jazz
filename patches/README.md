## uniffi-bindgen-react-native@0.29.3-1.patch

This patch contains a necessary fix for the `uniffi-bindgen-react-native` package that is required during the build phase. The fix has not yet been released to the main npm package.

**Important:** This patch is only needed during the build phase and won't be included in release artifacts. It's a build-time dependency fix that will be removed once the upstream package publishes the fix in an official release.

# Jazz - The database that syncs

**Jazz is a new kind of distributed database that runs across your frontend, containers, serverless functions and its own cloud.**

It syncs data, files and LLM streams instantly and feels like reactive local JSON state.

Built-in auth, orgs, multiplayer, edit history, permissions, encryption, offline support and more.

Self-host or use Jazz Cloud for zero-config magic. Open source (MIT)

## Getting started

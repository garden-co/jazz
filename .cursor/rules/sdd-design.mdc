# SDD workflow

When the user asks to implement a feature, follow this workflow:

1. Create a feature directory under `.specs/{feature_name}` (kebab-case).
2. Create `requirements.md` with:
   - Introduction
   - User stories + acceptance criteria (EARS style)
3. Ask: "Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design."
4. Once approved, create `design.md` with:
   - Overview
   - Architecture / components
   - Data models
   - Error handling / testing strategy
5. Ask: "Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan."
6. Once approved, create `tasks.md` with:
   - Numbered checklist of coding tasks
   - Each task references specific requirements
   - Only coding tasks (no deployment, docs, etc.)
7. Ask: "Do the tasks look good?"
8. Stop. Do not implement anything yet.

Important:
- Do not skip steps.
- Always ask for explicit approval before moving to the next step.
- Do not implement code in this workflow.

# SDD task execution

When the user asks to execute a task from a spec:

1. Read:
   - `.specs/{feature_name}/requirements.md`
   - `.specs/{feature_name}/design.md`
   - `.specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md`
2. Focus on ONE task at a time.
3. Implement only that task, referencing requirements and design.
4. Once done, stop and let the user review.
5. Do not automatically move to the next task.
6. Mark the task as [x] in `tasks.md`.

Important:
- Only execute one task per interaction.
- Do not implement functionality for other tasks.
- If the user doesn’t specify a task, suggest the next one in the list.

# Using AI to build Jazz apps

AI tools, particularly large language models (LLMs), can accelerate your development with Jazz. Searching docs, responding to questions and even helping you write code are all things that LLMs are starting to get good at.

However, Jazz is a rapidly evolving framework, so sometimes AI might get things a little wrong.

To help the LLMs, we provide the Jazz documentation in a txt file that is optimized for use with AI tools, like Cursor.

## Setting up AI tools

Every tool is different, but generally, you'll need to either paste the contents of the [llms-full.txt](https://jazz.tools/llms-full.txt) file directly in your prompt, or attach the file to the tool.

### ChatGPT and v0

Upload the txt file in your prompt.

### Cursor

1. Go to Settings > Cursor Settings > Features > Docs
2. Click "Add new doc"
3. Enter the following URL:

<CodeGroup>
```
https://jazz.tools/llms-full.txt
```
</CodeGroup>

## llms.txt convention

We follow the llms.txt [proposed standard](https://llmstxt.org/) for providing documentation to AI tools at inference time that helps them understand the context of the code you're writing.

## Limitations and considerations

AI is amazing, but it's not perfect. What works well this week could break next week (or be twice as good).

We're keen to keep up with changes in tooling to help support you building the best apps, but if you need help from humans (or you have issues getting set up), please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/utDMjHYg42).

# CoLists

CoLists are ordered collections that work like JavaScript arrays. They provide indexed access, iteration methods, and length properties, making them perfect for managing sequences of items.

## Creating CoLists

CoLists are defined by specifying the type of items they contain:

<CodeGroup preferWrap>
```ts index.ts#Basic
```
</CodeGroup>

To create a `CoList`:

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#Create
```
</CodeGroup>

### Ownership

Like other CoValues, you can specify ownership when creating CoLists.

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#WithOwner
```
</CodeGroup>

See [Groups as permission scopes](/docs/permissions-and-sharing/overview) for more information on how to use groups to control access to CoLists.

## Reading from CoLists

CoLists support standard array access patterns:

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#ArrayAccess
```
</CodeGroup>

## Updating CoLists

Methods to update a CoList's items are grouped inside the `$jazz` namespace:

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#Updating
```
</CodeGroup>

### Soft Deletion
You can do a soft deletion by using a deleted flag, then creating a helper method that explicitly filters out items where the deleted property is true.

<CodeGroup>
```ts soft-deletions.ts#SoftDeletion
```
</CodeGroup>

There are several benefits to soft deletions:
- **recoverablity** - Nothing is truly deleted, so recovery is possible in the future
- **data integrity** - Relationships can be maintained between current and deleted values
- **auditable** - The data can still be accessed, good for audit trails and checking compliance

### Deleting Items

Jazz provides two methods to retain or remove items from a CoList:

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#Deletion
```
</CodeGroup>

You can also remove specific items by index with `splice`, or remove the first or last item with `pop` or `shift`:

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#SpliceAndShift
```
</CodeGroup>

### Array Methods

`CoList`s support the standard JavaScript array methods you already know. Methods that mutate the array
are grouped inside the `$jazz` namespace.

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#PushFindFilter
```
</CodeGroup>

### Type Safety

CoLists maintain type safety for their items:

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#TypeSafety
```
</CodeGroup>
## Best Practices

### Common Patterns

#### List Rendering

CoLists work well with UI rendering libraries:

<CodeGroup>
```ts TaskList.tsx
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Managing Relations

CoLists can be used to create one-to-many relationships:

<CodeGroup>
```ts relations.ts
```
</CodeGroup>

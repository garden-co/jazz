# CoTexts

Jazz provides two CoValue types for collaborative text editing, collectively referred to as "CoText" values:

- **`co.plainText()`** for simple text editing without formatting
- **`co.richText()`** for rich text with HTML-based formatting (extends `co.plainText()`)

Both types enable real-time collaborative editing of text content while maintaining consistency across multiple users.

**Note:** If you're looking for a quick way to add rich text editing to your app, check out [our prosemirror plugin](#using-rich-text-with-prosemirror).

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#Basic
```
</CodeGroup>

For a full example of CoTexts in action, see [our Richtext example app](https://github.com/garden-co/jazz/tree/main/examples/richtext-prosemirror), which shows plain text and rich text editing.

## `co.plainText()` vs `z.string()`

While `z.string()` is perfect for simple text fields, `co.plainText()` is the right choice when you need:

- Frequent text edits that aren't just replacing the whole field
- Fine-grained control over text edits (inserting, deleting at specific positions)
- Multiple users editing the same text simultaneously
- Character-by-character collaboration
- Efficient merging of concurrent changes

Both support real-time updates, but `co.plainText()` provides specialized tools for collaborative editing scenarios.

## Creating CoText Values

CoText values are typically used as fields in your schemas:

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#Comparison
```
</CodeGroup>

Create a CoText value with a simple string:

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#StringInitial
```
</CodeGroup>

### Ownership

Like other CoValues, you can specify ownership when creating CoTexts.

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#Ownership
```
</CodeGroup>

See [Groups as permission scopes](/docs/permissions-and-sharing/overview) for more information on how to use groups to control access to CoText values.

## Reading Text

CoText values work similarly to JavaScript strings:

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#Reading
```
</CodeGroup>

<ContentByFramework framework="react">
When using CoTexts in JSX, you can read the text directly:
<CodeGroup>
```tsx react.tsx#JSX
```
</CodeGroup>
</ContentByFramework>

## Making Edits

Insert and delete text with intuitive methods:

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#Editing
```
</CodeGroup>

### Applying Diffs

Use `applyDiff` to efficiently update text with minimal changes:

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#ApplyDiff
```
</CodeGroup>

Perfect for handling user input in form controls:

<ContentByFramework framework="react">
<CodeGroup>
```ts react.tsx#TextEditor
```
</CodeGroup>
</ContentByFramework>

<ContentByFramework framework="vanilla">
<CodeGroup>
```ts vanilla.ts#PlainText
```
</CodeGroup>
</ContentByFramework>

<ContentByFramework framework="svelte">
<CodeGroup>
  ```svelte svelte.svelte
  ```
</CodeGroup>
</ContentByFramework>

## Using Rich Text with ProseMirror

Jazz provides a dedicated plugin for integrating `co.richText()` with the popular ProseMirror editor that enables bidirectional synchronization between your co.richText() instances and ProseMirror editors.

### ProseMirror Plugin Features

- **Bidirectional Sync**: Changes in the editor automatically update the `co.richText()` and vice versa
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously
- **HTML Conversion**: Automatically converts between HTML (used by `co.richText()`) and ProseMirror's document model

### Installation

<CodeGroup>
```bash
pnpm add prosemirror-view \
  prosemirror-state \
  prosemirror-schema-basic
```
</CodeGroup>

# Codecs

You can use Zod `z.codec()` schemas to store arbitrary data types such as class instances within CoValues by defining custom encoders.
This allows you to directly use these data types within CoValues without having to do an extra manual conversion step.

## Using Zod codecs

To use a Zod `z.codec()` with Jazz, your encoder must encode the data into a JSON-compatible format.
This is means that the `Input` type shall map to the JSON-compatible type, and `Output` will map to your custom type.

Schemas that are not directly supported by Jazz such as `z.instanceof` are not re-exported by Jazz under the `z` object.
The full Zod API is exported under `z.z` if you need to use any of these schemas as part of a codec.

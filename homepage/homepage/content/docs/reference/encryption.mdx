# Encryption

Jazz uses proven cryptographic primitives in a novel, but simple protocol to implement auditable permissions while allowing real-time collaboration and offline editing.

## How encryption works

Jazz uses proven cryptographic primitives in a novel, but simple protocol to implement auditable permissions while allowing real-time collaboration and offline editing.

### Write permissions: Signing with your keys

When you create or modify CoValues, Jazz cryptographically signs every transaction:

- All transactions are signed with your account's signing keypair
- This proves the transaction came from you
- Whether transactions are valid depends on your permissions in the Group that owns the CoValue
- Groups have internal logic ensuring only admins can change roles or create invites
- You can add yourself to a Group only with a specific role via invites

### Read permissions: Symmetric encryption

Groups use a shared "read key" for encrypting data:

- Admins reveal this symmetric encryption key to accounts with "reader" role or higher
- All transactions in CoValues owned by that Group are encrypted with the current read key
- When someone is removed from a Group, the read key rotates and gets revealed to all remaining members
- CoValues start using the new read key for future transactions

This means removed members can't read new data, but existing data they already had access to remains readable to them.

## Key rotation and security

Jazz automatically handles key management:

- **Member removal triggers rotation**: When you remove someone from a Group, Jazz generates a new read key
- **Seamless transition**: New transactions use the new key immediately
- **No data loss**: Existing members get the new key automatically

## Streaming encryption

Jazz encrypts data efficiently for real-time collaboration:

- **Incremental hashing**: CoValue sessions use [Blake3](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3) for append-only hashing
- **Session signatures**: Each session is signed with [ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) after each transaction
- **Stream ciphers**: Data is encrypted using [xsalsa20](https://cr.yp.to/salsa20.html) stream cipher
- **Integrity protection**: Hashing and signing ensure data hasn't been tampered with

## Content addressing

CoValue IDs are the [Blake3](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3) hash of their immutable "header" (containing CoValue type and owning group). This allows CoValues to be "content addressed" while remaining dynamic and changeable.

## What this means for you

**Privacy by default**: Your data is always encrypted, even on Jazz Cloud servers. Only people you explicitly give access to can read your data.

**Flexible permissions**: Use Groups to control exactly who can read, write, or admin your CoValues.

**Automatic security**: Key rotation and encryption happen behind the scenes - you don't need to think about it.

**Verifiable authenticity**: Every change is cryptographically signed, so you always know who made what changes.

### Implementation details

The cryptographic primitives are implemented in the [`cojson/src/crypto`](https://github.com/garden-co/jazz/tree/main/packages/cojson/src/crypto) package.

# Jazz Workflow World

Vercel Workflows allow developers to create durable, reliable, observable functions using TypeScript.

You can use a simple, declarative API to define and use your workflows, replacing hand-rolled queues and custom retries.

[Learn more about using Workflow](https://useworkflow.dev/), or

## Getting started

We recommend using Jazz Cloud as a backend for your workflows. Your workflow state will be persisted using Jazz, allowing you to run and deploy your apps without any additional infrastructure.

## Get your free API key

<GetAPIKey />

Set your API key in your .env.local or production environment variables.

<FileName>.env.local</FileName>
*(or add to your production environment variables)*
<CodeGroup>
```bash
JAZZ_API_KEY=<your-app-api-key>
WORKFLOW_TARGET_WORLD=workflow-world-jazz
```
</CodeGroup>

## Install the Jazz Workflow World

Install the Jazz Workflow World, and add `WORKFLOW_TARGET_WORLD=workflow-world-jazz` to your `.env.local` file (or your production environment variables) to take use the Jazz Workflow World for running your workflows.

<TabbedCodeGroup default="pnpm" savedPreferenceKey="package-manager" id="install-jazz-workflow-world">
<TabbedCodeGroupItem label="npm">
```sh
npm add workflow-world-jazz
```
</TabbedCodeGroupItem>
<TabbedCodeGroupItem label="pnpm">
```sh
pnpm add workflow-world-jazz
```
</TabbedCodeGroupItem>
</TabbedCodeGroup>

## Create a worker

Head over to https://dashboard.jazz.tools/ and create a new app. Once your app is ready, you'll see the option to *Create Worker Group*. This will do two things:

1. Create a group, with a group ID, a master account ID, and a master account secret. This account is used for revocation and rotation of workers, and should *not* be used as a normal worker.
2. Create a normal worker with an ID and a secret, which can be used to run your workflows.

<Alert variant="info" title="Note">
  Secrets displayed in the Jazz dashboard will only appear once. Make sure to save them somewhere secure. If you lose them, you will need to create a new worker group.
</Alert>

Click to create a worker group. Save **all** these details securely!

## Add your worker ID and secret to your environment variables

<FileName>.env.local</FileName>
*(or add to your production environment variables)*
<CodeGroup>
```bash
JAZZ_API_KEY=<your-app-api-key>
WORKFLOW_TARGET_WORLD=workflow-world-jazz
JAZZ_WORKER_ACCOUNT=<your-worker-id>
JAZZ_WORKER_SECRET=<your-worker-secret>
```
</CodeGroup>

## Set up webhooks

### For local development

Run the following command to configure a local webhook registry (which is needed to progress the workflow from your development environment). The webhook registry details will be added automatically to your environment variables.

<TabbedCodeGroup default="pnpm" savedPreferenceKey="package-manager" id="create-registry">
<TabbedCodeGroupItem label="npm">
```sh
npx env-cmd -f .env.local -x npx jazz-run webhook create-registry --grant \$JAZZ_WORKER_ACCOUNT >> .env.local
```
</TabbedCodeGroupItem>
<TabbedCodeGroupItem label="pnpm">
```sh
pnpx env-cmd -f .env.local -x -- pnpx jazz-run webhook create-registry --grant \$JAZZ_WORKER_ACCOUNT >> .env.local
```
</TabbedCodeGroupItem>
</TabbedCodeGroup>

<details>
  <summary>What's this?</summary>

  A webhook registry is a service that allows you to respond to state changes in your workflow. Let's break this down.

  * `env-cmd -f .env.local -x`&hairsp;—&hairsp; allows the `jazz-run` tool to read the environment variables you've already set in your `.env.local` file
  * `jazz-run webhook create-registry`&hairsp;—&hairsp;creates a registry
  * `--grant \$JAZZ_WORKER_ACCOUNT`&hairsp;—&hairsp;grants access to the worker you just created (where the `\` is escaping the dollar sign in the terminal).

</details>

Once your webhook registry is configured, you can start it up using the following command:

<TabbedCodeGroup default="pnpm" savedPreferenceKey="package-manager" id="run-registry">
<TabbedCodeGroupItem label="npm">
```sh
npx env-cmd -f .env.local npx jazz-run webhook run
```
</TabbedCodeGroupItem>
<TabbedCodeGroupItem label="pnpm">
```sh
pnpx env-cmd -f .env.local -- pnpx jazz-run webhook run
```
</TabbedCodeGroupItem>
</TabbedCodeGroup>
<CodeGroup>
```bash
```
</CodeGroup>

<details>
  <summary>What's this?</summary>

  Same as above, but this time, we're actually running the webhook registry server

  * `env-cmd -f .env.local -x`&hairsp;—&hairsp;allows the `jazz-run` tool to read the environment variables you've already set in your `.env.local` file
  * `jazz-run webhook run`&hairsp;—&hairsp;runs a server hosting the webhooks.

</details>

### For production

On the https://dashboard.jazz.tools/ dashboard, you can turn on the *Enable Webhooks* toggle. You'll see a new environment variable added to your *Worker Environment Variables*: `JAZZ_WEBHOOK_REGISTRY_ID`. Add this to your production environment variables, along with `JAZZ_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT`, which should be the URL of your production application's public URL.

## Develop your workflows

You can now run your app, and start using workflows!

<RunDevServer />

## Self-hosting

You can also host the sync server and webhook registry yourself using our open-source sync server.

### Run your sync server

You can run a sync server from the command line using the following command:

<TabbedCodeGroup default="pnpm" savedPreferenceKey="package-manager" id="run-sync">
<TabbedCodeGroupItem label="npm">
```sh
npx jazz-run sync
```
</TabbedCodeGroupItem>
<TabbedCodeGroupItem label="pnpm">
```sh
pnpx jazz-run sync
```
</TabbedCodeGroupItem>
</TabbedCodeGroup>

Your sync server will start by default at `http://localhost:4200`. In case you are running the sync server in production, we recommend using a reverse proxy. In this case, replace `localhost:4200` from this point on with the public URL for your sync server.

### Create a worker account

You can create a worker account locally from the terminal:

<TabbedCodeGroup default="pnpm" savedPreferenceKey="package-manager" id="run-sync">
<TabbedCodeGroupItem label="npm">
```sh
npx jazz-run account create --peer http://localhost:4200 --name "Workflow Worker" >> .env.local
```
</TabbedCodeGroupItem>
<TabbedCodeGroupItem label="pnpm">
```sh
pnpx jazz-run account create --peer http://localhost:4200 --name "Workflow Worker" >> .env.local
```
</TabbedCodeGroupItem>
</TabbedCodeGroup>

### Create a webhook registry

As you're running the sync server outside the Jazz cloud, you'll need to host your own webhook registry. You can create a webhook registry locally from the terminal:

<TabbedCodeGroup default="pnpm" savedPreferenceKey="package-manager" id="sh-registry">
<TabbedCodeGroupItem label="npm">
  ```sh
  npx env-cmd -f .env.local -x npx jazz-run webhook create-registry --peer http://localhost:4200 --grant \$JAZZ_WORKER_ACCOUNT >> .env.local
  ```
</TabbedCodeGroupItem>
<TabbedCodeGroupItem label="pnpm">
```sh
pnpx env-cmd -f .env.local -x -- pnpx jazz-run webhook create-registry --peer http://localhost:4200 --grant \$JAZZ_WORKER_ACCOUNT >> .env.local
```
</TabbedCodeGroupItem>
</TabbedCodeGroup>


### Tell Jazz about your sync server

Your `.env.local` file should now contain all the environment variables you need to run your app, except for the URL of the sync server.

Add `JAZZ_SYNC_SERVER=http://localhost:4200` to your `.env.local` file.

Your `.env.local` file should look like this:

<FileName>.env.local</FileName>
<CodeGroup>
```bash
WORKFLOW_TARGET_WORLD=workflow-world-jazz
JAZZ_WORKER_ACCOUNT=<your-worker-id>
JAZZ_WORKER_SECRET=<your-worker-secret>
JAZZ_WEBHOOK_REGISTRY_ID=<your-webhook-registry-id>
JAZZ_WEBHOOK_REGISTRY_SECRET=<your-webhook-registry-secret>
JAZZ_SYNC_SERVER=http://localhost:4200
```
</CodeGroup>

### Develop your workflows

You can now run your app, and start using workflows!

<RunDevServer />

### Deploying to production

In order to deploy your app to production, you will need to have both the sync server and the webhook registry available as long-running processes, with the correct environment variables set.

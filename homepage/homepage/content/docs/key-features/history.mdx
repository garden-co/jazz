# History

Jazz tracks every change to your data automatically. See who changed what, when they did it, and even look at your data from any point in the past.

See the [version history example](https://github.com/garden-co/jazz/tree/main/examples/version-history) for reference.

Let's use the following schema to see how we can use the edit history.


<CodeGroup>
```ts schema.ts#Basic
```
</CodeGroup>

## The $jazz.getEdits() method

Every CoValue has a `$jazz.getEdits()` method that contains the complete history for each field. Here's
how to get the edit history for `task.status`:

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#GetEdits
```
</CodeGroup>

## Edit Structure

Each edit contains:

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#EditDetails
```
</CodeGroup>

## Accessing History

### Latest Edit

Get the most recent change to a field:

<CodeGroup>
```ts index#Latest
```
</CodeGroup>

### All Edits

Get the complete history for a field:

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#All
```
</CodeGroup>

### Initial Values

The first edit contains the initial value:

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#Initial
```
</CodeGroup>

### Created Date and Last Updated Date

To show created date and last updated date, use the `$jazz.createdAt` and `$jazz.lastUpdatedAt` getters.

<CodeGroup>
```tsx index.ts#CreatedAtLastUpdatedAt
```
</CodeGroup>

## Requirements

- CoValues must be loaded to access history (see [Subscription & Loading](/docs/core-concepts/subscription-and-loading))
- History is only available for fields defined in your schema
- Edit arrays are ordered chronologically (oldest to newest)

## Common Patterns

For practical implementations using history, see [History Patterns](/docs/reference/design-patterns/history-patterns):
- Building audit logs
- Creating activity feeds
- Implementing undo/redo
- Showing change indicators
- Querying historical data

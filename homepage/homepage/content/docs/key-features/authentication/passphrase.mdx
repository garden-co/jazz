# Passphrase Authentication

Passphrase authentication lets users log into any device using a recovery phrase consisting of multiple words (similar to cryptocurrency wallets). Users are responsible for storing this passphrase safely.

## How it works

When a user creates an account with passphrase authentication:

1. Jazz generates a unique recovery phrase derived from the user's cryptographic keys
2. This phrase consists of words from a wordlist
3. Users save this phrase and enter it when logging in on new devices

You can use one of the ready-to-use wordlists from the [BIP39 repository](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bip39/tree/a7ecbfe2e60d0214ce17163d610cad9f7b23140c/src/wordlists) or create your own. If you do decide to create your own wordlist, it's recommended to use at least 2048 unique words (or some higher power of two).

## Key benefits

- **Portable**: Works across any device, even without browser or OS support
- **User-controlled**: User manages their authentication phrase
- **Flexible**: Works with any wordlist you choose
- **Offline capable**: No external dependencies

## Implementation

{/* TODO: Convert to TCG */}
{/* TODO: Add Svelte */}
<ContentByFramework framework="react">
<CodeGroup>
```tsx AuthModal.tsx#Basic
```
</CodeGroup>
</ContentByFramework>

<ContentByFramework framework={["react-native", "react-native-expo"]}>
<CodeGroup>
```tsx AuthModalRN.tsx#Basic
```
</CodeGroup>
</ContentByFramework>

## Examples

You can see passphrase authentication in our [passphrase example](https://passphrase.demo.jazz.tools/) or the [todo list demo](https://todo.demo.jazz.tools/).

## When to use Passphrases

Passphrase authentication is ideal when:

- You need to support older browsers without WebAuthn capabilities
- Your users need to access the app on many different devices
- You want a fallback authentication method alongside passkeys

## Limitations and considerations

- **User responsibility**: Users must securely store their passphrase
- **Recovery concerns**: If a user loses their passphrase, they cannot recover their account
- **Security risk**: Anyone with the passphrase can access the account
- **User experience**: Requires users to enter a potentially long phrase

Make sure to emphasize to your users:
1. Store the passphrase in a secure location (password manager, written down in a safe place)
2. The passphrase is the only way to recover their account
3. Anyone with the passphrase can access the account

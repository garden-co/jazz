# Cross-Device Account Transfer

Cross-Device Account Transfer can be used to transfer authentication from one device to another, for example using a QR code.

## How it works

Cross-Device Account Transfer supports two flows, where **Desktop** refers to the device that creates and displays the QR code, and **Mobile** refers to the device that scans and handles it:

- **Mobile to Desktop**: Mobile scans the QR code to authenticate the desktop device
- **Desktop to Mobile**: Mobile scans the QR to authenticate itself

Once the QR code has been scanned, the already-authenticated `source` device shows a 6-digit code that the user should enter on the `target` device trying to authenticate.

If the confirmation code is correct, the source device reveals the secret, and the target device uses it to authenticate.

You can pick a flow that suits your use case, or use both!

## Key benefits

- **Portable**: Apps using passkey auth for example can use cross-device account transfer links to authenticate devices where the passkey is not available
- **User-friendly**: Users familiar with WhatsApp, Discord, etc. already know how this works

## Implementation

<ContentByFramework framework="react">
### Mobile to Desktop

We start by creating a link on the **Desktop** device using `useCreateCrossDeviceAccountTransfer` as `target`, and handling the flow's `status`:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx twoslash
import { useCreateCrossDeviceAccountTransfer } from "jazz-react";
import React, { useState } from "react";
interface CreateAccountTransferAsTargetProps {
  onLoggedIn: () => void;
}
const QRCode = (_: { url: string }) => (<></>)
const ConfirmationCodeForm = (_: { onSubmit: (code: string) => void}) => (<></>)


// ---cut---
export function CreateAccountTransferAsTarget({
  onLoggedIn,
}: CreateAccountTransferAsTargetProps) {
  const [link, setLink] = useState<string | undefined>();

  const { status, createLink, sendConfirmationCode } = useCreateCrossDeviceAccountTransfer({
    as: "target",
    onLoggedIn,
  });

  // Handle the status
}
```
</CodeGroup>

[Full example](https://github.com/garden-co/jazz/blob/main/examples/cross-device-account-transfer/src/components/CreateCrossDeviceAccountTransferAsTarget.tsx)

On the **Mobile** side, we need to host a page at `/account-transfer-handler-source`, or provide an alternative handler path to the hooks using the `sourceHandlerPath` option.

This is the page we'll land on when the QR code is scanned, handling the link with the `useHandleCrossDeviceAccountTransfer` hook as `source`, and using `status` to display the current state:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { useHandleCrossDeviceAccountTransfer } from "jazz-react";

// ---cut---
export function HandleAccountTransferAsSource() {
  const { status, confirmationCode } = useHandleCrossDeviceAccountTransfer({
    as: "source",
  });

  // Handle the status
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Desktop to Mobile

This is similar to the **Mobile to Desktop** flow, but the roles are reversed: `useCreateCrossDeviceAccountTransfer` on the **Desktop** device should be used as `source`, and `useHandleCrossDeviceAccountTransfer` on the **Mobile** device should be used as `target`.

On the **Desktop** device:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx twoslash
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useCreateCrossDeviceAccountTransfer } from "jazz-react";
const QRCode = (_: { url: string }) => (<></>)

// ---cut---
export function CreateAccountTransferAsSource() {
  const [link, setLink] = useState<string | undefined>();

  const { status, createLink, confirmationCode } = useCreateCrossDeviceAccountTransfer({
    as: "source",
  });

  // Handle the status
}
```
</CodeGroup>

[Full example](https://github.com/garden-co/jazz/blob/main/examples/cross-device-account-transfer/src/components/CreateCrossDeviceAccountTransferAsSource.tsx)

On the **Mobile** device we need to host a page at `/account-transfer-handler-target`, or provide an alternative handler path to the hooks using the `targetHandlerPath` option.

This is the page we'll land on when the QR code is scanned, handling the link with the `useHandleCrossDeviceAccountTransfer` hook as `target`, and using `status` to display the current state:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { useHandleCrossDeviceAccountTransfer } from "jazz-react";
const ConfirmationCodeForm = (_: { onSubmit: (code: string) => void}) => (<></>)

// ---cut---
export function HandleAccountTransferAsTarget() {
  const { status, sendConfirmationCode } = useHandleCrossDeviceAccountTransfer({
    as: "target",
    targetHandlerPath: "/#/account-transfer-handler-target",
    sourceHandlerPath: "/#/account-transfer-handler-source",
    onLoggedIn: () => {
      console.log("logged in!");
    },
  });

  // Handle the status
}
```
</CodeGroup>

- [todo](https://todo-demo.jazz.tools/): Mobile to Desktop flow implemented as a more practical demo - [code](https://github.com/garden-co/jazz/blob/main/examples/todo)

## When to use Cross-Device Account Transfer

Ideal when:

- You need a fallback authentication method alongside passkeys
- Your app is designed to be used on mobile devices

## Limitations and considerations

- **No revocation**: Once the secret has been shared with the target device, it cannot be revoked
- **Requires a camera**: The link handler needs to have a camera to scan the QR code, or another way to get the link

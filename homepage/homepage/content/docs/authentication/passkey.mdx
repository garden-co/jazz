# Passkey Authentication

Passkey authentication is fully local-first and the most secure of the auth methods that Jazz provides because keys are managed by the device/operating system itself.

## How it works

Passkey authentication is based on the [Web Authentication API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API) and uses familiar FaceID/TouchID flows that users already know how to use.

## Key benefits

- **Most secure**: Keys are managed by the device/OS
- **User-friendly**: Uses familiar biometric verification (FaceID/TouchID)
- **Cross-device**: Works across devices with the same biometric authentication
- **No password management**: Users don't need to remember or store anything
- **Wide support**: Available in most modern browsers

## Implementation

<ContentByFramework framework="react">
Using passkeys in Jazz is as easy as this:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx twoslash
import * as React from "react";
import { useState } from "react";
import { usePasskeyAuth } from "jazz-react";
type AuthModalProps = {
  open: boolean;
  onOpenChange: (open: boolean) => void;
}
// ---cut---
export function AuthModal({ open, onOpenChange }: AuthModalProps) {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState("");

  const auth = usePasskeyAuth({ // Must be inside the JazzProvider!
    appName: "My super-cool web app",
  });

  if (auth.state === "signedIn") { // You can also use `useIsAuthenticated()`
    return <div>You are already signed in</div>;
  }

  const handleSignUp = async () => {
    await auth.signUp(username);
    onOpenChange(false);
  };

  const handleLogIn = async () => {
    await auth.logIn();
    onOpenChange(false);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleLogIn}>Log in</button>
      <input type="text" value={username} onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={handleSignUp}>Sign up</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
</CodeGroup>
</ContentByFramework>

## Examples

You can try passkey authentication using our [passkey example](https://passkey.demo.jazz.tools/) or the [music player demo](https://music.demo.jazz.tools/).

## When to use Passkeys

Passkeys are ideal when:
- Security is a top priority
- You want the most user-friendly authentication experience
- You're targeting modern browsers and devices
- You want to eliminate the risk of password-based attacks

## Limitations and considerations

- Requires hardware/OS support for biometric authentication
- Not supported in older browsers (see browser support below)
- Requires a fallback method for unsupported environments

### Browser Support

[Passkeys are supported in most modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/passkeys).

For older browsers, we recommend using [passphrase authentication](./passphrase) as a fallback.

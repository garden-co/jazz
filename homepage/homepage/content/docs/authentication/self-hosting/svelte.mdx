# Self-Hosted Authentication

We do not currently support using self-hosted authentication with Svelte.
We do have support for [React](/docs/react/authentication/self-hosting), [Expo](/docs/react-native-expo/authentication/self-hosting), and [vanilla JavaScript](/docs/vanilla/authentication/self-hosting).

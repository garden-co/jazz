# Jazz Cloud Authentication

The [Jazz Cloud](/cloud) platform provides a comprehensive solution for user management. This integration allows users to sign up or sign in through your Jazz application, using authentication infrastructure managed by us.

## How it works

Jazz Cloud Authentication works by providing a set of APIs that your application can use to authenticate users. These APIs are designed to be used in conjunction with the [Jazz Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.jazz.tools/), which provides a user interface for configuring managed [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) servers for your application.

### Developer

To integrate Jazz Cloud Authentication into your application, follow these steps:

1. Register your application in the Jazz Cloud Dashboard.
  - The application will be assigned an authentication URL for every environment; this URL must be supplied to the authentication client.
2. Add the authentication client to your application.
3. Implement the UI for your application's supported authentication methods.

### User

When using Jazz Cloud Authentication, users:

1. Sign up or sign in through your Jazz application.
2. Jazz Cloud securely stores the user's account keys and provides a seamless authentication experience.
3. When logging in, Jazz retrieves the user's account keys from Jazz Cloud.
4. Users can work offline with full Jazz functionality.

This authentication method is not fully local-first, as it relies on a connection to Jazz Cloud to authenticate and retrieve account keys.

## Key benefits

- **Multi-tenancy**: Authentication separated across application environments.
- **Developer-friendly**: Easy integration and setup.
- **Methods supported**: Email & password and OAuth providers supported out-of-the-box.
- **User-friendly**: Standard authentication flows users already know.

## Implementation

<ContentByFramework framework="vanilla">
We offer Jazz Cloud Authentication integration through our package: [`jazz-auth-betterauth`](https://npmjs.com/package/jazz-auth-betterauth).

<CodeGroup>
```tsx twoslash
const authUrl: string = "https://auth.jazz.tools/exampleApiKey/api/auth/";
const userName: string = "Firstname Lastname";
const userEmail: string = "user@example.com";
const userPassword: string = "12345678";
const authenticate = async () => {};
import { AuthSecretStorage } from "jazz-tools";
const authSecretStorage = new AuthSecretStorage();
// ---cut---
import { BetterAuth } from "jazz-auth-betterauth";
// @annotate: Creating the authentication client.

const auth = new BetterAuth(authenticate, authSecretStorage, { baseURL: authUrl });
// @annotate: Signing up with email & password

await auth.authClient.signUp.email({
  name: userName,
  email: userEmail,
  password: userPassword,
}, {
  onSuccess: async () => {
    await auth.signIn();
  }
});
// @annotate: Signing in with email & password

await auth.authClient.signIn.email({
  email: userEmail,
  password: userPassword
}, {
  onSuccess: async () => {
    await auth.logIn();
  }
});
```

</ContentByFramework>

<ContentByFramework framework="react">
We offer Jazz Cloud Authentication integration through our package: [`jazz-react-auth-betterauth`](https://npmjs.com/package/jazz-react-auth-betterauth).

The package provides a `useBetterAuth` hook for managing authentication state.

<CodeGroup>
```tsx twoslash
import * as React from "react";
const authUrl: string = "https://auth.jazz.tools/exampleApiKey/api/auth/";
const userName: string = "Firstname Lastname";
const userEmail: string = "user@example.com";
const userPassword: string = "12345678";
// ---cut---
import { useBetterAuth } from "jazz-react-auth-betterauth";
// @annotate: Creating the authentication client.

const auth = useBetterAuth({ baseURL: authUrl });
// @annotate: Signing up with email & password

await auth.authClient.signUp.email({
  name: userName,
  email: userEmail,
  password: userPassword,
}, {
  onSuccess: async () => {
    await auth.signIn();
  }
});
// @annotate: Signing in with email & password

await auth.authClient.signIn.email({

### Authentication Context

To share the authentication client & state across your application, you can use [React contexts](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context).

<CodeGroup>
```tsx twoslash
import * as React from "react";
const authUrl: string = "https://auth.jazz.tools/exampleApiKey/api/auth/";
// ---cut---
// @annotate: src/components/JazzAndAuth.tsx

"use client";

import { JazzProvider } from "jazz-react";
import { AuthProvider } from "jazz-react-auth-betterauth";
import { type ReactNode, lazy } from "react";

export function JazzAndAuth({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
	return (
		<JazzProvider
			sync={{
				peer: "wss://cloud.jazz.tools/?key=documentation-example@garden.co",
			}}
		>
			<>
				<AuthProvider
					options={{
						baseURL: authUrl
					}}
				>
					{children}
				</AuthProvider>
			</>
		</JazzProvider>
	);
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Within any component where your context is imported, you may then use `const auth = useAuth();`.

### Social Sign-On

To integrate social sign-on into your application, configure the social provider's credentials in the Jazz Cloud Dashboard. Once configured, you may trigger social-sign on using the authentication client.

<CodeGroup>
```tsx twoslash
import { useBetterAuth } from "jazz-react-auth-betterauth";
const authUrl: string = "https://auth.jazz.tools/exampleApiKey/api/auth/";
const auth = useBetterAuth({ baseURL: authUrl });
const providerName = "github" as Parameters<typeof auth.authClient.signIn.social>[0]["provider"];
// ---cut---
// @annotate: Sign-in with SSO provider

await auth.authClient.signIn.social({
	provider: providerName,
	callbackURL: `${window.location.origin}/social/logIn`,
});
// @annotate: Sign-up with SSO provider

await auth.authClient.signIn.social({
	provider: providerName,
	callbackURL: `${window.location.origin}/social/signIn`,
});
```
</CodeGroup>

To complete the sign-up or sign-in, create callback routes that update the local Jazz authentication state.

Here's an example with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/):

<CodeGroup>
```tsx twoslash
import { useBetterAuth } from "jazz-react-auth-betterauth";
const authUrl: string = "https://auth.jazz.tools/exampleApiKey/api/auth/";
const auth = useBetterAuth({ baseURL: authUrl });
// ---cut---
// @annotate: social/logIn/page.tsx

"use client";

import { redirect } from "next/navigation";

export default function Page() {
	auth.logIn().then(redirect("/"));
	return null;
}
```
```tsx twoslash
import { useBetterAuth } from "jazz-react-auth-betterauth";
const authUrl = "https://auth.jazz.tools/exampleApiKey/api/auth/";
const auth = useBetterAuth({ baseURL: authUrl });
// ---cut---
// @annotate: social/signIn/page.tsx

"use client";

import { redirect } from "next/navigation";

export default function Page() {
	auth.signIn().then(redirect("/"));
	return null;
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Examples

You can explore Jazz applications using Jazz Cloud Authentication integration in our [example projects](/docs/examples).

## When to use Jazz Cloud

Jazz Cloud Authentication is appropriate when:

- You want a traditional & seamless authentication experience for your users.
- You do not want to manage user accounts yourself.
- You want multi-tenant authentication across application environments.
- Your application would benefit from email & password authentication, with password resets and email verification.
- Your application would benefit from social sign-on, such as through Google or GitHub.
- You want to avoid users managing their own account keys.

## Limitations and considerations

- **Online requirement**: Internet connectivity is required when authenticating.

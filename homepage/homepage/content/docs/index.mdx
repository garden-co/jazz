**Jazz is a new kind of database** that's **distributed** across your frontend, containers, serverless functions and its own storage cloud.

It syncs structured data, files and LLM streams instantly, and looks like local reactive JSON state.

It also provides auth, orgs & teams, real-time multiplayer, edit histories, permissions, E2E encryption and offline-support out of the box.

## Quickstart

**Want to learn the basics?** Check out our [quickstart guide](/docs/quickstart) for a step-by-step guide to building a simple app with Jazz.

**Just want to get started?** You can use [`create-jazz-app`](/docs/tooling-and-resources/create-jazz-app) to create a new Jazz project from one of our starter templates or example apps:

<CodeGroup>
  ```sh
    npx create-jazz-app@latest --api-key you@example.com
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Using an LLM?** <a href="https://jazz.tools/llms-full.txt" download>Add our llms.txt</a> to your context window!

## How it works

1. **Define your data** with CoValues schemas
2. **Connect to storage infrastructure** (Jazz Cloud or self-hosted)
3. **Create and edit CoValues** like normal objects
4. **Get automatic sync and persistence** across all devices and users

Your UI updates instantly on every change, everywhere. It's like having reactive local state that happens to be shared with the world.

## Ready to see Jazz in action?

Have a look at our [example apps](/examples) for inspiration and to see what's possible with Jazz. From real-time chat and collaborative editors to file sharing and social features — these are just the beginning of what you can build.

## Core concepts

Learn how to structure your data using [collaborative values](/docs/core-concepts/covalues/overview) — the building blocks that make Jazz apps work.

## Sync and storage

Sync and persist your data by setting up [sync and storage infrastructure](/docs/core-concepts/sync-and-storage) using Jazz Cloud, or host it yourself.

## Going deeper

Get better results with AI by [importing the Jazz docs](/docs/tooling-and-resources/ai-tools) into your context window.

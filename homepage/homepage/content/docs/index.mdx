**Jazz is a new kind of database** that's **distributed** across your frontend, containers, serverless functions and its own storage cloud.

It syncs structured data, files and LLM streams instantly, and looks like local reactive JSON state.

It also provides auth, orgs & teams, real-time multiplayer, edit histories, permissions, E2E encryption and offline-support out of the box.

### Just want to get started?
You can use [`create-jazz-app`](/docs/tooling-and-resources/create-jazz-app) to create a new Jazz project from one of our starter templates or example apps:
<CodeGroup>
  ```sh
    npx create-jazz-app@latest --api-key you@example.com
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<ContentByFramework framework="react">
  **Using an LLM?** <a href="/react/llms-full.txt" download>Add our llms.txt</a> to your context window!
</ContentByFramework>
<ContentByFramework framework="svelte">
  **Using an LLM?** <a href="/svelte/llms-full.txt" download>Add our llms.txt</a> to your context window!
</ContentByFramework>
<ContentByFramework framework="react-native">

## How it works

1. **Define your data** with CoValues schemas
2. **Connect to storage infrastructure** (Jazz Cloud or self-hosted)
3. **Create and edit CoValues** locally
4. **Get automatic sync and persistence** across all devices and users

Your UI updates instantly on every change, everywhere. It's like having reactive local state that happens to be shared with the world.

## A Minimal Jazz App
Here, we'll scratch the surface of what you can do with Jazz. We'll build a quick and easy To Do list app&hairsp;—&hairsp;easy to use, easy to build, and easy to make comparisons with!

This is the end result: we're showing it here running in two iframes, updating in real-time through the Jazz Cloud.

Try adding items on the left and watch them appear instantly on the right!

<DemoToDo />
<Alert variant="info" title="Using Jazz Cloud">
  These two iframes are syncing through the Jazz Cloud. You can use the toggle in the top right to enable or disable sync for each client, and see how with Jazz, you can keep working even when you're offline.
</Alert>

### Imports
Start by importing Jazz into your app.

<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#Imports
```
</CodeGroup>

### Schema
Then, define what your data looks like using [Collaborative Values](/docs/core-concepts/covalues/overview)&hairsp;—&hairsp;the building blocks that make Jazz apps work.
<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#InlineSchema
```
</CodeGroup>

### Context
Next, [give your app some context](/docs/project-setup#give-your-app-context) and tell Jazz your sync strategy&hairsp;—&hairsp;use the Jazz Cloud to get started quickly. We'll also create our to do list and get its ID here to use later. 
<CodeGroup>
```ts routing.ts#Context
```
</CodeGroup>

### Build your UI
Now, build a basic UI skeleton for your app.
<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#BuildUI
```
</CodeGroup>

### Display Items
Display your items and add logic to mark them as done...
<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#toDoItemElement
```
</CodeGroup>

### Add New Items
...and add new items to the list using an input and a button.
<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#newToDoFormElement
```
</CodeGroup>

### Subscribe to Changes
Now for the magic: listen to changes coming from [**anyone, anywhere**](/docs/permissions-and-sharing/overview), and update your UI in real time.
<CodeGroup>
```ts index.ts#SubscribeToChanges
```
</CodeGroup>

### Simple Routing
Lastly, we'll add a tiny bit of routing logic to be able to share the list by URL: if there's an `id` search parameter, that'll be the list we'll subscribe to later. If we don't have an `id`, we'll [create a new ToDo list](/docs/core-concepts/covalues/colists#creating-colists). We'll replace the section where we created the `ToDoList` above.

<CodeGroup>
```ts routing.ts#SimpleRouting
```
</CodeGroup>

### All Together
Put it all together for a simple Jazz app in less than 100 lines of code.
<CodeGroup preferWrap>
```ts index.ts
```
</CodeGroup>

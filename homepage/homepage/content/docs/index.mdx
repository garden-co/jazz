**Jazz is a toolkit for building backendless apps**. You get data without needing a database — plus auth, permissions, files and multiplayer without needing a backend. Jazz lets you do everything right from the frontend and you'll ship better apps, faster.

Instead of wrestling with databases, APIs, and server infrastructure, you work with **CoValues** ("collaborative values") — your new cloud-synced building blocks that feel like local state but automatically sync across all devices and users in real-time.

---

**Note:** We just released [Jazz 0.14.0](/docs/upgrade/0-14-0) with a bunch of breaking changes and are still cleaning the docs up - see the [upgrade guide](/docs/upgrade/0-14-0) for details.

## Quickstart

You can use [`create-jazz-app`](/docs/tools/create-jazz-app) to create a new Jazz project from one of our starter templates or example apps:

<CodeGroup>
```sh
npx create-jazz-app@latest --api-key you@example.com
```
</CodeGroup>

{/* <ContentByFramework framework="react">
  Or you can follow this [React step-by-step guide](/docs/react/guide) where we walk you through building an issue tracker app.
</ContentByFramework> */}

## Why Jazz is different

Most apps rebuild the same thing: shared state that syncs between users and devices. Jazz starts from that shared state, giving you:

- **No backend required** — Focus on building features, not infrastructure
- **Real-time sync** — Changes appear everywhere immediately  
- **Multiplayer by default** — Collaboration just works
- **Local-first** — Your app works offline and feels instant

Think Figma, Notion, or Linear — but you don't need years to build a custom stack.

## How it works

1. **Define your data** with CoValues schemas
2. **Connect to sync infrastructure** (Jazz Cloud or self-hosted)
3. **Create and edit CoValues** like normal objects
4. **Get automatic sync and persistence** across all devices and users

Your UI updates instantly on every change, everywhere. It's like having reactive local state that happens to be shared with the world.

## Ready to see Jazz in action?

Have a look at our [example apps](/examples) for inspiration and to see what's possible with Jazz. From real-time chat and collaborative editors to file sharing and social features — these are just the beginning of what you can build.

## Core concepts

Learn how to structure your data using [collaborative values](/docs/schemas/covalues) — the building blocks that make Jazz apps work.

## Sync and storage

Sync and persist your data by setting up [sync and storage infrastructure](/docs/sync-and-storage) using Jazz Cloud, or host it yourself.

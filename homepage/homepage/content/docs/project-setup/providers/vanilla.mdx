# Providers

If you're using vanilla JS, you won't be able to use an off the shelf provider. Instead, you need to provide context to your app yourself.

[Find out more here](/docs/vanilla/project-setup).

Alternatively, if you're looking to implement a provider yourself in a framework we don't support, you can check our reference implementations to see how it could be done:

* [React](https://github.com/garden-co/jazz/blob/main/packages/jazz-tools/src/react/provider.tsx)
* [Svelte](https://github.com/garden-co/jazz/blob/main/packages/jazz-tools/src/svelte/Provider.svelte)
* [Vue](https://github.com/garden-co/jazz/blob/main/packages/community-jazz-vue/src/provider.ts)&hairsp;—&hairsp;Community maintained

### Finding Unique CoValues with findUnique

Jazz provides a powerful mechanism to find unique CoMap instances based on their `CoValueUniqueness` identifier. 
The `findUnique` method allows for the location of specific CoMap instances without needing to load them first.

#### When to use findUnique
Use findUnique when there's an assigned unique identifier on a CoMap (via CoValueUniqueness) and you want to retrieve that specific instance. 
This is particularly useful for:
- **Singleton CoValues** - If a `CoMap` should only ever have one instance
- **Referencing specific instances** - When there's a need to access a CoMap that is known by its unique ID and owner

```ts twoslash
import {co, z, Group} from "jazz-tools"
const group = Group.create();
---cut-before---
const Project = co.map({
    name: z.string(),
    startDate: z.date(),
    status: z.literal(["planning", "active", "completed"]),
    coordinator: z.optional(Member),
});

const project = Project.create(
    {
        {
        name: "Spring Planting",
        startDate: new Date("2025-03-20"),
        status: "planning"
        },
    },
    { owner: group, unique: { name: "Spring Planting" } },
);

const foundProject = Project.findUnique({ name: "Spring Planting" }, group.id);
```

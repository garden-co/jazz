Welcome to the Jazz documentation!

The Jazz docs are currently heavily work in progress, sorry about that!

## Quickstart

Run the following command to create a new Jazz project from one of our example apps:
<CodeGroup>
```sh
npx create-jazz-app
```
</CodeGroup>

Or set up Jazz yourself, using the following instructions for your framework of choice:

- [React](/docs/react/project-setup)
- [Next.js](/docs/react/project-setup#nextjs)
- [React Native](/docs/react-native/project-setup)
- [Vue](/docs/vue/project-setup)
- [Svelte](/docs/svelte/project-setup)

<ContentByFramework framework="react">
  Or you can follow this [React step-by-step guide](/docs/react/guide) where we walk you through building an issue tracker app.
</ContentByFramework>

## Example apps

You can also find [example apps](/examples) with code most similar to what you want to build. These apps
make use of different features such as auth, file upload, and more.

## Sync and storage

Sync and persist your data by setting up a [sync and storage infrastructure](/docs/sync-and-storage) using Jazz Cloud, or do it yourself.

## Collaborative values

Learn how to structure your data using [collaborative values](/docs/schemas/covalues).

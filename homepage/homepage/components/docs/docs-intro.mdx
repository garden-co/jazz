Welcome to the Jazz documentation!

The Jazz docs are currently heavily work in progress, sorry about that!

## Quickstart

Run the following command to create a new Jazz project from one of our starter apps:

<ContentByFramework framework="react">
  <CodeGroup>
  ```sh
  npx create-jazz-app@latest --framework react
  ```
  </CodeGroup>

 Or follow the [project setup guide](/docs/svelte/project-setup).
</ContentByFramework>

<ContentByFramework framework="vue">
  <CodeGroup>
  ```sh
  npx create-jazz-app@latest --framework vue
  ```
  </CodeGroup>

 Or follow the [project setup guide](/docs/svelte/project-setup).
</ContentByFramework>

<ContentByFramework framework="svelte">
  <CodeGroup>
  ```sh
  npx create-jazz-app@latest --framework svelte
  ```
  </CodeGroup>

 Or follow the [project setup guide](/docs/svelte/project-setup).
</ContentByFramework>

<ContentByFramework framework="react-native">
  <CodeGroup>
  ```sh
  npx create-jazz-app@latest --framework rn
  ```
  </CodeGroup>

 Or follow the [project setup guide](/docs/svelte/project-setup).
</ContentByFramework>

### Use an example app as a template

You can also find [example apps](/examples) with code most similar to what you want to build. These apps
make use of different features such as auth, file upload, and more.

To start a new Jazz app from one of these example apps, run the following command:

<CodeGroup>
```sh
npx create-jazz-app@latest --example [example-name]
```
</CodeGroup>

Replace `[example-name]` with the repository name of one of the example apps [here](https://github.com/garden-co/jazz/tree/main/examples).

### Choose a package manager (optional)

By default, an app generated by `create-jazz-app` uses `npm` as the package manager.

Alternatively, you can use `yarn`, `pnpm`, `bun`, or `deno`.

<CodeGroup>
```sh
npx create-jazz-app@latest --package-manager [package-manager]
```
</CodeGroup>

## Sync and storage

Sync and persist your data by setting up a [sync and storage infrastructure](/docs/sync-and-storage) using Jazz Cloud, or do it yourself.

## Collaborative values

Learn how to structure your data using [collaborative values](/docs/schemas/covalues).

## API Reference

Many of the packages provided are documented in the [API Reference](/api-reference).

## LLM Docs

We support the [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) convention for making documentation available to large language models and the applications that make use of them.

We currently have:

- [/llms.txt](/llms.txt) - A overview listing of the available packages and their documentation
- [/llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt) - Full documentation for our packages

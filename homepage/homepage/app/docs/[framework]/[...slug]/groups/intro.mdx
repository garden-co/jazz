## Adding Group Members by ID

You can add group members by ID by using `Account.load` and `Group.addMember`.

<CodeGroup>
```tsx
import { Group, Account } from "jazz-tools";

const group = Group.create({ owner: me });

const bob = await Account.load(bobsID, me, []);
group.addMember(bob, "writer");
```
</CodeGroup>

Note: if the account ID is of type `string`, because it comes from a URL parameter or something similar, you need to cast it to `ID<Account>` first:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx
import { Group, Account, ID } from "jazz-tools";

const bob = await Account.load(bobsID as ID<Account>, me, []);
group.addMember(bob, "writer");
```
</CodeGroup>

## Getting the Group of an existing CoValue

You can get the group of an existing CoValue by using `coValue._owner`.

<CodeGroup>
```tsx
const group = existingCoValue._owner;
const newValue = MyCoMap.create(
  { color: "red"},
  { owner: group }
);
```
</CodeGroup>

Because `._owner` can be an `Account` or a `Group`, in cases where you specifically need to use `Group` methods (such as for adding members or getting your own role), you can cast it to assert it to be a Group:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";

const group = existingCoValue._owner.castAs(Group);
group.addMember(bob, "writer");
group.myRole();
```
</CodeGroup>

# Magic Link Authentication

Magic Links can be used to transfer authentication from one device to another, for example using a QR code.

We refer to the device that is already authenticated as the **provider** and the one that wants to authenticate as the **consumer**. In our examples, **desktop** is the device that displays the QR code, and **mobile** is the device that scans it.

Transferring authentication is supported in both directions: the **desktop** device can act as the provider while the **mobile** device acts as the consumer and vice versa.

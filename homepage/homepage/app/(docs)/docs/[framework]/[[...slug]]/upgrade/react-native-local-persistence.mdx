# Enable local persistence

Version 0.9.2 introduces local persistence for React Native apps using SQLite.

If you are upgrading from a version before 0.9.2, you need to enable local persistence by following the steps below.

Local persistence will become the default in 0.10.0.

## Add the required dependencies

As SQLite package we now use `@op-engineering/op-sqlite`.

To get local persistence working, you need to add `@op-engineering/op-sqlite` as a direct dependency to your project and run `npx pod-install`.

## Update your JazzProvider to enable local persistence

Local persistence is now disabled by default.

To enable it, you need to pass the `storage` option to the `JazzProvider` component:

<CodeGroup>
  ```tsx
  <JazzProvider
    auth={auto}
    storage="sqlite"
    peer="wss://cloud.jazz.tools/?key=you@example.com"
    AccountSchema={MyAppAccount}
  >
    <App />
  </JazzProvider>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

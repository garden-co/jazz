# Jazz 0.13.0 - React Native Split

Version 0.13.0 introduces a significant architectural change in how Jazz supports React Native applications. We've separated the React Native implementation into two distinct packages to better serve different React Native development approaches:

1. **[jazz-react-native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jazz-react-native)**: Focused package for framework-less React Native applications
2. **[jazz-expo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jazz-expo)**: Dedicated package for Expo applications
3. **[jazz-react-native-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jazz-react-native-core)**: Shared core functionality used by both implementations

If you're using React Native without Expo, see the [React Native Upgrade Guide](/docs/react-native/upgrade/0-13-0). If you're using Expo, please see the [Expo upgrade guide](/docs/react-native-expo/upgrade/0-13-0).

## Summary of Changes

- **Split Implementation**: React Native support is now divided into separate packages for Expo and framework-less React Native
- **Clerk Authentication**: Clerk auth is now included directly in the jazz-expo package
- **Storage Adapters**: Each implementation uses platform-optimized storage solutions

- [Expo Upgrade Guide](/docs/react-native-expo/upgrade/0-13-0)

# Create Jazz App

Jazz comes with a CLI tool that helps you quickly scaffold new Jazz applications with your preferred framework and authentication method.

## Quick Start

Create a new Jazz app in seconds:

<CodeGroup>
```bash
npx create-jazz-app@latest
```
</CodeGroup>

This launches an interactive CLI that guides you through selecting:
- Your framework (React, Vue, Svelte, Next.js, React Native)
- Authentication method (Demo, Passkey, Clerk)
- Package manager
- Project name

## One-liner

If you know what you want, specify everything in one go:

<CodeGroup>
```bash
npx create-jazz-app@latest my-app\
  --starter react-passkey-auth\
  --package-manager npm
```
</CodeGroup>

## Start From an Example

Need inspiration? Use one of our example apps as your starting point:

<CodeGroup>

```
</CodeGroup>

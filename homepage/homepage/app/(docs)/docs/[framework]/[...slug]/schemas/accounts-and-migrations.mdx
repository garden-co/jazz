# Accounts & Migrations

## CoValues as a graph of data rooted in accounts

Compared to traditional relational databases with tables and foreign keys,
Jazz is more like a graph database, or GraphQL APIs &mdash;
where CoValues can arbitrarily refer to each other and you can resolve references without having to do a join.
(See [Subscribing & deep loading](/docs/using-covalues/subscription-and-loading)).

To find all data related to a user, the account acts as a root node from where you can resolve all the data they have access to.
These root references are modeled explicitly in your schema, distinguishing between data that is typically public
(like a user's profile) and data that is private (like their messages).

### `Account.root` - private data a user cares about

Every Jazz app that wants to refer to per-user data needs to define a custom root `CoMap` schema and declare it in a custom `Account` schema as the `root` field:

<CodeGroup>
{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
import { Account, CoMap } from "jazz-tools";

export class MyAppAccount extends Account {
  root = co.ref(MyAppRoot);
}

export class MyAppRoot extends CoMap {
  myChats = co.ref(ListOfChats);
  myContacts = co.ref(ListOfAccounts);
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### `Account.profile` - public data associated with a user

The built-in `Account` schema class comes with a default `profile` field, which is a CoMap (in a Group with `"everyone": "reader"` - so publicly readable permissions)
that is set up for you based on the username the `AuthMethod` provides on account creation.

Their pre-defined schemas roughly look like this:

<CodeGroup>
{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
// ...somehwere in jazz-tools itself...
export class Account extends Group {
  profile = co.ref(Profile);
}

export class Profile extends CoMap {
  name = co.string;
}
```
</CodeGroup>

If you want to keep the default `Profile` schema, but customise your account's private `root`, all you have to do is define a new `root` field in your account schema:

(You don't have to explicitly re-define the `profile` field, but it makes it more readable that the Account contains both `profile` and `root`)

<CodeGroup>
{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
import { Account, Profile } from "jazz-tools";

export class MyAppAccount extends Account {
  profile = co.ref(Profile);
  root = co.ref(MyAppRoot);
}
```
</CodeGroup>
If you want to extend the `profile` to contain additional fields (such as an avatar `ImageDefinition`), you can declare your own profile schema class that extends `Profile`:

<CodeGroup>
{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
import { Account, Profile, ImageDefinition } from "jazz-tools";

export class MyAppAccount extends Account {
  profile = co.ref(MyAppProfile);
  root = co.ref(MyAppRoot);// old
}

export class MyAppRoot extends CoMap {// old
  myChats = co.ref(ListOfChats);// old
  myContacts = co.ref(ListOfAccounts);// old
}// old

export class MyAppProfile extends Profile {
  name = co.string; // compatible with default Profile schema
  avatar = co.optional.ref(ImageDefinition);
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Resolving CoValues starting at `profile` or `root`

<ContentByFramework framework="react">
To use per-user data in your app, you typically use `useAccount` somewhere in a high-level component, specifying which references to resolve using a depth-spec (see [Subscribing & deep loading](/docs/using-covalues/subscription-and-loading)).

<CodeGroup>
{/* prettier-ignore */}
```tsx
import { useAccount } from "jazz-react";

function DashboardPageComponent() {
  const { me } = useAccount({ profile: {}, root: { myChats: {}, myContacts: {}}});

  return <div>
    <h1>Dashboard</h1>
    {me ? <div>
      <p>Logged in as {me.profile.name}</p>
      <h2>My chats</h2>
      {me.root.myChats.map((chat) => <ChatPreview key={chat.id} chat={chat} />)}
      <h2>My contacts</h2>
      {me.root.myContacts.map((contact) => <ContactPreview key={contact.id} contact={contact} />)}
    </div> : "Loading..."}
  </div>
}

```
</CodeGroup>
</ContentByFramework>


## Populating and evolving `root` and `profile` schemas with migrations

As you develop your app, you'll likely want to

- initialise data in a user's `root` and `profile`
- add more data to your `root` and `profile` schemas

You can achieve both by overriding the `migrate()` method on your `Account` schema class.

### When migrations run

Migrations are run after account creation and every time a user logs in.
Jazz waits for the migration to finish before passing the account to your app's context.

### Initialising user data after account creation

<CodeGroup>
{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
export class MyAppAccount extends Account {
  root = co.ref(MyAppRoot);

  async migrate() {
    // we specifically need to check for undefined, 
    // because the root might simply be not loaded (`null`) yet
    if (this.root === undefined) {
      this.root = MyAppRoot.create({
        // Using a group to set the owner is always a good idea.
        // This way if in the future we want to share 
        // this coValue we can do so easily.
        myChats: ListOfChats.create([], Group.create()),
        myContacts: ListOfAccounts.create([], Group.create())
      });
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Adding/changing fields to `root` and `profile`

To add new fields to your `root` or `profile` schemas, amend their corresponding schema classes with new fields,
and then implement a migration that will populate the new fields for existing users (by using initial data, or by using existing data from old fields).

To do deeply nested migrations, you might need to use the asynchronous `ensureLoaded()` method before determining whether the field already exists, or is simply not loaded yet.

Now let's say we want to add a `myBookmarks` field to the `root` schema:

<CodeGroup>
{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
export class MyAppAccount extends Account {
    root = co.ref(MyAppRoot);// old

    async migrate() { // old
      if (this.root === undefined) {  // old
        this.root = MyAppRoot.create({  // old
          myChats: ListOfChats.create([], Group.create()),  // old
          myContacts: ListOfAccounts.create([], Group.create()) // old
        }); // old
      } // old

      // We need to load the root field to check for the myContacts field
      const result = await this.ensureLoaded({
        root: {},
      });

      const { root } = result;

      // we specifically need to check for undefined, 
      // because myBookmarks might simply be not loaded (`null`) yet 
      if (root.myBookmarks === undefined) {
        root.myBookmarks = ListOfBookmarks.create([], Group.create());
      }
    }
  }
```
</CodeGroup>

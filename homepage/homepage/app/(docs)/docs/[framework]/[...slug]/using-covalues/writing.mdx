# Writing & deleting CoValues

Collaborative applications need ways to update and remove data. Jazz makes this simple by treating CoValues like regular JavaScript objects while handling all the complexity of syncing changes in the background. This page covers how to modify CoValues, work with collections, handle concurrent edits, and properly remove data when needed.

## Writing to CoValues

Once you have a CoValue, modifying it is straightforward. You can update fields like regular JavaScript properties. Changes are applied locally first for immediate feedback, then synchronized to other users with access to the same CoValues. This approach provides a natural programming model while handling all the distributed systems complexity behind the scenes.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
class Task extends CoMap {
  title = co.string;
  status = co.literal("todo", "in-progress", "completed");
  assignee = co.optional.string;
}

//...

// Update fields
task.status = "in-progress";             // Direct assignment
task.assignee = "Alex";                  // Optional field
```
</CodeGroup>

### Working with Lists

CoLists support familiar array operations, making it easy to work with collections of data. You can add, remove, and modify items using the standard JavaScript array methods, while Jazz handles the collaborative aspects automatically. These operations work correctly even when multiple users are making changes simultaneously.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
class Project extends CoMap {
  name = co.string;
  tasks = co.ref(ListOfTasks);
}

//...

// Add items
project.tasks.push(Task.create({
  title: "Build raised beds",
  status: "todo"
}));

// Remove items
project.tasks.splice(2, 1);  // Remove third task

// Update items
project.tasks[0].status = "in-progress";

// Bulk updates
project.tasks.forEach(task => {
  if (task.status === "todo") {
    task.status = "in-progress";
  }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

Changes sync automatically to everyone with access. Any edits you make are immediately visible in your local view and propagate to other users as they sync.

## Concurrent Edits

CoValues use [CRDTs](/docs/schemas/covalues#defining-schemas-covalues) to handle concurrent edits smoothly. In most cases, you don't need to think about conflicts - Jazz handles them automatically. This conflict resolution happens transparently, allowing multiple users to make changes simultaneously without disruption or data loss.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
class Dashboard extends CoMap {
  activeProjects = co.number;
  status = co.literal("active", "maintenance");
  notifications = co.ref(ListOfNotifications);
}

//...

// Multiple users can edit simultaneously
// Last-write-wins for simple fields
dashboard.status = "maintenance";     // Local change is immediate
dashboard.activeProjects = 5;         // Syncs automatically

// Lists handle concurrent edits too
dashboard.notifications.push(Notification.create({
  timestamp: new Date(),
  message: "System update scheduled"
}));
```
</CodeGroup>

## Deleting CoValues

There are a few ways to delete CoValues, from simple field removal to full cleanup. Jazz provides flexible options for removing data depending on your needs. You can remove references while keeping the underlying data, remove items from lists, or completely delete CoValues when they're no longer needed.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
class Project extends CoMap {
  tasks = co.ref(ListOfTasks);
  resources = co.optional.ref(ListOfResources);
}

//...

// Remove a reference
project.resources = null;  // Removes the reference but resources still exist

// Remove from a list
project.tasks.splice(2, 1);  // Removes third team member from list
```
</CodeGroup>

### Best Practices

- Load everything you plan to delete
- Check permissions before attempting deletes
- Consider soft deletes for recoverable data

## Removing Data in CoValues

You can delete fields from any `CoMap` to remove specific properties while keeping the CoValue itself. This is useful when you need to clear certain data without affecting the rest of your object structure. The deletion operations are also synchronized to all users with access.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
class Project extends CoMap {
  name = co.string;
  team = co.ref(ListOfMembers);
  budget = co.optional.ref(Budget);
}

//...

// Delete fields from a regular CoMap
delete project.budget;  // Removes the budget reference

// Delete from a record-type CoMap
class ProjectTags extends CoMap.Record(co.string) {}

const projectTags = ProjectTags.create({
  "priority-high": "High priority tasks",
});

delete projectTags["priority-high"]; // Removes specific tag

```
</CodeGroup>

For `CoList`s, use array methods:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
// Remove from lists using splice
project.team.splice(2, 1);  // Removes third team member
```
</CodeGroup>

### Restoring Data

For data you might want to restore later, consider using status fields instead of permanent deletion. This "soft delete" pattern is common in applications where users might need to recover previously removed items. By using a boolean field to mark items as archived or deleted, you maintain the ability to restore them later.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
class Task extends CoMap {
  title = co.string;
  archived = co.boolean;
}

// Mark as archived
task.archived = true;

// Restore later
task.archived = false; // Task is back in the active list!
```
</CodeGroup>

Removed data remains in the edit history. If you need to handle sensitive information, plan your data model accordingly.

# Writing & deleting CoValues

## Writing to CoValues

Once you have a CoValue, modifying it is straightforward. You can update fields like regular JavaScript properties:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
class Marine extends CoMap {
  name = co.string;
  status = co.literal("ready", "injured", "unknown");
  lastKnownLocation = co.optional.string;
}

// Simple field updates
marine.status = "injured";                 // Direct assignment
marine.lastKnownLocation = "Sub-Level 3";  // Optional field

// Multiple updates
marine.update({
  status: "unknown",
  lastKnownLocation: null
});
```
</CodeGroup>

### Working with Lists

CoLists support familiar array operations:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
class Squad extends CoMap {
  name = co.string;
  members = co.ref(ListOfMarines);
}

// Add items
squad.members.push(Marine.create({
  name: "Vasquez",
  status: "ready"
}));

// Remove items
squad.members.splice(2, 1);  // Remove third marine

// Update items
squad.members[0].status = "unknown";

// Bulk updates
squad.members.forEach(marine => {
  marine.status = "ready";
});
```
</CodeGroup>

Changes sync automatically to everyone with access. Any edits you make are immediately visible in your local view and propagate to other users as they sync.

## Concurrent Edits

CoValues use CRDTs to handle concurrent edits smoothly. In most cases, you don't need to think about conflicts - Jazz handles them automatically:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
class MotionTracker extends CoMap {
  location = co.string;
  status = co.literal("active", "offline");
  readings = co.ref(ListOfReadings);
}

// Multiple users can edit simultaneously
// Last-write-wins for simple fields
tracker.status = "offline";        // Local change is immediate
tracker.location = "Sector 12B";   // Syncs automatically

// Lists handle concurrent edits too
tracker.readings.push(Reading.create({
  timestamp: new Date(),
  movement: "multiple signatures"
}));
```
</CodeGroup>

### Error Handling

Write operations can fail for several reasons:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
try {
  marine.status = "ready";
} catch (error) {
  if (error.message.includes("permission")) {
    console.error("Not authorized to update marine status");
  } else {
    console.error("Failed to update status:", error);
  }
}

```
</CodeGroup>

## Deleting CoValues

There are a few ways to delete CoValues, from simple field removal to full cleanup:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
class Ship extends CoMap {
  crew = co.ref(ListOfCrew);
  cargo = co.optional.ref(CargoManifest);
  missionLog = co.ref(Log);
}

// Remove a reference
ship.cargo = null;  // Removes the reference but cargo still exists

// Remove from a list
ship.crew.splice(2, 1);  // Removes third crew member from list

// Delete a CoValue entirely
await ship.missionLog.delete();  // Completely removes the log
```
</CodeGroup>


### Best Practices

- Load everything you plan to delete
- Use transactions for complex deletions
- Check permissions before attempting deletes 
- Consider soft deletes for recoverable data

## Removing Data in CoValues

You can delete fields from any `CoMap`:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
class Ship extends CoMap {
  name = co.string;
  crew = co.ref(ListOfCrew);
  cargo = co.optional.ref(CargoManifest);
}

// Delete fields from a regular CoMap
delete ship.cargo;  // Removes the cargo reference

// Delete from a record-type CoMap
class Inventory extends CoMap.Record(co.ref(Item)) {}
delete inventory["motion-tracker"];  // Removes specific item
```
</CodeGroup>

For `CoList`s, use array methods:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
// Remove from lists using splice
ship.crew.splice(2, 1);  // Removes third crew member
```
</CodeGroup>

### Restoring Data

For data you might want to restore later, consider using status fields instead:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
class Marine extends CoMap {
  name = co.string;
  deleted = co.boolean;
}

// Mark as deleted
marine.deleted = true;

// Restore
marine.deleted = false; // Tada~!
```
</CodeGroup>

Removed data remains in the edit history. If you need to handle sensitive information, plan your data model accordingly.

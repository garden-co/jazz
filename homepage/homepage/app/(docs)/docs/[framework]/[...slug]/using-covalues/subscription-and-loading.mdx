# Subscriptions & Deep Loading

When working with collaborative applications, you need to know when data changes and ensure you have all the necessary related data. Jazz provides powerful subscription and deep loading capabilities that make it easy to keep your UI in sync with the underlying data and efficiently load complex object graphs.

## Understanding Subscriptions

Subscriptions in Jazz allow you to react to changes in CoValues. When a CoValue changes, all subscribers are notified with the updated value. This is essential for building reactive UIs that stay in sync with collaborative data.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
class Task extends CoMap {
  title = co.string;
  description = co.string;
  status = co.literal("todo", "in-progress", "completed");
  assignedTo = co.optional.string;
}

// ...

// Subscribe to a Task by ID
const unsubscribe = Task.subscribe(taskId, { /* loading depth */ }, (updatedTask) => {
  console.log("Task updated:", updatedTask.title);
  console.log("New status:", updatedTask.status);
});

// Later, when you're done:
unsubscribe();
```
</CodeGroup>

### Static vs. Instance Subscriptions

There are two main ways to subscribe to CoValues:

1. **Static Subscription** - When you have an ID but don't have the CoValue loaded yet:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
// Subscribe by ID (static method)
const unsubscribe = Task.subscribe(taskId, { /* loading depth */ }, (task) => {
  if (task) {
    console.log("Task loaded/updated:", task.title);
  }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

2. **Instance Subscription** - When you already have a CoValue instance:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
// Subscribe to an instance (instance method)
const task = Task.create({
  status: "todo",
  title: "Cut the grass",
});
if (task) {
  const unsubscribe = task.subscribe({ /* loading depth */ }, (updatedTask) => {
    console.log("Task updated:", updatedTask.title);
  });
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Deep Loading

When working with related CoValues (like tasks in a project), you often need to load not just the top-level object but also its nested references. Jazz provides a flexible mechanism for specifying exactly how much of the object graph to load.

### Loading Depth Specifications

Loading depth specifications let you declare exactly which references to load and how deep to go:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
class Project extends CoMap {
  name = co.string;
  tasks = co.ref(ListOfTasks);
  owner = co.ref(TeamMember);
}

class Task extends CoMap {
  title = co.string; 
  subtasks = co.ref(ListOfSubtasks);
  assignee = co.optional.ref(TeamMember);
}

// Load just the project, not its tasks
const project = await Project.load(projectId, {});

// Load the project and its tasks (but not subtasks)
const projectWithTasks = await Project.load(projectId, { 
  tasks: {}
});

// Load the project, its tasks, and their subtasks
const projectDeep = await Project.load(projectId, {
  tasks: {
    subtasks: {}
  }
});

// Load the project, its tasks, and task assignees
const projectWithAssignees = await Project.load(projectId, {
  tasks: {
    assignee: {}
  }
});

// Complex loading pattern: load project, tasks with their subtasks, and the project owner
const fullyLoaded = await Project.load(projectId, {
  tasks: {
    subtasks: {}
  },
  owner: {}
});
```
</CodeGroup>

The depth specification object mirrors the structure of your data model, making it intuitive to express which parts of the graph you want to load.

### Array Notation for Lists

For lists, you can use array notation to specify how to load the items:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
// Load project with all tasks but load each task shallowly
const project = await Project.load(projectId, {
  tasks: [{}]
});

// Load project with tasks and load subtasks for each task
const project = await Project.load(projectId, {
  tasks: [{
    subtasks: [{}]
  }]
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Framework Integration

<ContentByFramework framework="react">
### React Integration with useCoState

In React applications, the `useCoState` hook provides a convenient way to subscribe to CoValues and handle loading states:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx
function GardenPlanner({ projectId }: { projectId: ID<Project> }) {
  // Subscribe to a project and its tasks
  const project = useCoState(Project, projectId, {
    tasks: [{}]
  });

  // Handle loading state
  if (!project) {
    return <div>Loading garden project...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{project.name}</h1>
      <TaskList tasks={project.tasks} />
    </div>
  );
}

function TaskList({ tasks }: { tasks: Task[] }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {tasks.map(task => (
        <li key={task.id}>
          <span>{task.title}</span>
          <span>{task.status}</span>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```
</CodeGroup>

The `useCoState` hook handles subscribing when the component mounts and unsubscribing when it unmounts, making it easy to keep your UI in sync with the underlying data.
</ContentByFramework>

<ContentByFramework framework="vue">
### Vue Integration

In Vue applications, you can use the `useCoState` composable to subscribe to CoValues:

<CodeGroup>
```vue
<script setup>
import { useCoState } from 'jazz-vue';

const props = defineProps({
  projectId: String
});

// Subscribe to a project and its tasks
const project = useCoState(Project, props.projectId, {
  tasks: [{}]
});
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="project">
    <h1>{{ project.name }}</h1>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="task in project.tasks" :key="task.id">
        {{ task.title }} - {{ task.status }}
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div v-else>
    Loading garden project...
  </div>
</template>
```
</CodeGroup>
</ContentByFramework>

<ContentByFramework framework="svelte">
### Svelte Integration

In Svelte applications, you can use the `useCoState` function to subscribe to CoValues:

<CodeGroup>
```svelte
<script>
  import { useCoState } from 'jazz-svelte';
  
  export let projectId;
  
  // Subscribe to a project and its tasks
  const project = useCoState(Project, projectId, {
    tasks: [{}]
  });
</script>

{#if $project}
  <h1>{$project.name}</h1>
  <ul>
    {#each $project.tasks as task (task.id)}
      <li>{task.title} - {task.status}</li>
    {/each}
  </ul>
{:else}
  <div>Loading garden project...</div>
{/if}
```
</CodeGroup>
</ContentByFramework>

## Ensuring Data is Loaded

Sometimes you need to make sure data is loaded before proceeding with an operation. The `ensureLoaded` method lets you guarantee that a CoValue and its referenced data are loaded to a specific depth:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
async function completeAllTasks(projectId: ID<Project>) {
  // Ensure the project and its tasks are loaded
  const project = await Project.load(projectId, {});
  if (!project) return;
  
  const loadedProject = await project.ensureLoaded({
    tasks: [{}]
  });
  
  // Now we can safely access and modify tasks
  loadedProject.tasks.forEach(task => {
    task.status = "completed";
  });
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Performance Considerations

Loading depth is directly related to performance. Loading too much data can slow down your application, while loading too little can lead to "undefined" references. Here are some guidelines:

- **Load only what you need** for the current view or operation
- **Preload data** that will be needed soon to improve perceived performance
- Use **caching** to avoid reloading data that hasn't changed

{/* TODO: Add a note about supporting pagination */}

<CodeGroup>
```ts
// Bad: Loading everything deeply
const project = await Project.load(projectId, {
  tasks: [{ 
    subtasks: [{ 
      comments: [{}] 
    }]
  }],
  members: [{}],
  resources: [{}]
});

// Better: Loading only what's needed for the current view
const project = await Project.load(projectId, {
  tasks: [{}]  // Just load the tasks shallowly
});

// Later, when a task is selected:
const task = await Task.load(selectedTaskId, {
  subtasks: [{}]  // Now load its subtasks
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Using a Loading Cache

By default, Jazz maintains a cache of loaded CoValues to avoid unnecessary network requests. This means that if you've already loaded a CoValue, subsequent load requests will use the cached version unless you explicitly request a refresh.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
// First load: fetches from network or local storage
const project = await Project.load(projectId, {});

// Later loads: uses cached version if available
const sameProject = await Project.load(projectId, {});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

1. **Be explicit about loading depths**: Always specify exactly what you need
2. **Clean up subscriptions**: Always store and call the unsubscribe function when you're done
3. **Handle loading states**: Check for undefined/null before accessing properties
4. **Use framework integrations**: They handle subscription lifecycle automatically
5. **Balance depth and performance**: Load only what you need for the current view

By effectively using subscriptions and deep loading, you can build responsive, collaborative applications that handle complex data relationships while maintaining good performance.

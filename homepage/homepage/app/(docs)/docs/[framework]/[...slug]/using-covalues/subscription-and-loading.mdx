# Subscriptions & Deep Loading

When working with collaborative applications, you need to know when data changes and ensure you have all the necessary related data. Whether you're using [CoMaps](/docs/using-covalues/comaps), [CoLists](/docs/using-covalues/colists), or [CoFeeds](/docs/using-covalues/cofeeds), Jazz provides powerful subscription and deep loading capabilities that make it easy to keep your UI in sync with the underlying data and efficiently load complex object graphs.

## Understanding Subscriptions

Subscriptions in Jazz allow you to react to changes in CoValues. When a CoValue changes, all subscribers are notified with the updated value. This is essential for building reactive UIs that stay in sync with collaborative data.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
class Task extends CoMap {
  title = co.string;
  description = co.string;
  status = co.literal("todo", "in-progress", "completed");
  assignedTo = co.optional.string;
}

// ...

// Subscribe to a Task by ID
const unsubscribe = Task.subscribe(taskId, { resolve: {} }, (updatedTask) => {
  console.log("Task updated:", updatedTask.title);
  console.log("New status:", updatedTask.status);
});

// Clean up when you're done
unsubscribe();

```
</CodeGroup>

## Framework Integration

The subscription and loading patterns work seamlessly with all [CoValue types](/docs/using-covalues/comaps) in your application.

If you're using React in your project, check out our [React hooks](/docs/react/using-covalues/subscription-and-loading#framework-integration) which provide a more streamlined experience with automatic subscription management.
</ContentByFramework>

<ContentByFramework framework="react">
Jazz provides a `useCoState` hook that provides a convenient way to subscribe to CoValues and handle loading states:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx
function GardenPlanner({ projectId }: { projectId: ID<Project> }) {
  // Subscribe to a project and its tasks
  const project = useCoState(Project, projectId, {
    resolve: {
      tasks: true
    }
  });

  // Handle loading state
  if (project === undefined) {
    return <div>Loading garden project...</div>;
  }
  
  // Handle not found or not accessible
  if (project === null) {
    return <div>Project not found or not accessible</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{project.name}</h1>
      <TaskList tasks={project.tasks} />
    </div>
  );
}

function TaskList({ tasks }: { tasks: Task[] }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {tasks.map(task => (
        <li key={task.id}>
          <span>{task.title}</span>
          <span>{task.status}</span>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```
</CodeGroup>

The `useCoState` hook handles subscribing when the component mounts and unsubscribing when it unmounts, making it easy to keep your UI in sync with the underlying data.
</ContentByFramework>

## Loading States and Permission Checking

When subscribing to or loading a CoValue, you need to handle three possible states:

- `undefined`: The initial loading state, indicating the value is being fetched
- `null`: The CoValue was not found or is not accessible (e.g., due to permissions)
- `Value`: The successfully loaded CoValue instance

This allows you to handle loading, error, and success states in your application:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
Task.subscribe(taskId, { resolve: {} }, (task) => {
  if (task === undefined) {
    console.log("Task is loading...");
  } else if (task === null) {
    console.log("Task not found or not accessible");
  } else {
    console.log("Task loaded:", task.title);
  }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

### Granular Permission Handling

Jazz implements granular permission checking for collections of items. If a user has access to a list but not to some of its items, those items will be returned as `null` rather than causing the entire list to be inaccessible:

<ContentByFramework framework="react">
<CodeGroup>
```tsx
class ListOfTasks extends CoList.Of(co.optional.ref(Task)) {}

function TaskList({ projectId }) {
  // Load a project and its tasks
  const project = useCoState(Project, projectId, {
    resolve: {
      tasks: true
    }
  });

  if (project === undefined) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (project === null) return <div>Project not found or access denied</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{project.name}</h1>
      <ul>
        {/* 
          If the user lacks permission to some tasks, 
          those items will be null but others will be available
        */}
        {project.tasks.map((task, index) => 
          task ? (
            <li key={task.id}>{task.title}</li>
          ) : (
            <li key={index}>Task not accessible</li>
          )
        )}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```
</CodeGroup>
</ContentByFramework>

<ContentByFramework framework="vanilla">
<CodeGroup>
```ts
class ListOfTasks extends CoList.Of(co.optional.ref(Task)) {}

async function taskList({ projectId }) {
  const project = await Project.load(projectId, {
    resolve: { tasks: true } 
  });
  const tasks = project.tasks;

  if (tasks === undefined) return "Loading ...";
  if (tasks === null) return "Project not found or access denied";
  
  // Filter out null tasks and display as a list
  return project.tasks
    .filter(task => task !== null)
    .map(task => task.title)
    .join(`\n - `); 
}

const result = await taskList({ projectId }); // "Seed potatoes\n - Pick berries\n - Pick apples"
```
</CodeGroup>
</ContentByFramework>

This approach allows for more flexible UI experiences when working with collections where the user may have mixed permission levels for different items.

### Static vs. Instance Subscriptions

There are two main ways to subscribe to CoValues:

1. **Static Subscription** - When you have an ID but don't have the CoValue loaded yet:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
// Subscribe by ID (static method)
const unsubscribe = Task.subscribe(taskId, { resolve: {} }, (task) => {
  if (task) {
    console.log("Task loaded/updated:", task.title);
  }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

2. **Instance Subscription** - When you already have a CoValue instance:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
// Subscribe to an instance (instance method)
const task = Task.create({
  status: "todo",
  title: "Cut the grass",
});
if (task) {
  const unsubscribe = task.subscribe({ resolve: {} }, (updatedTask) => {
    console.log("Task updated:", updatedTask.title);
  });
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Deep Loading

When working with related CoValues (like tasks in a project), you often need to load not just the top-level object but also its nested references. This is especially important when working with [CoMaps](/docs/using-covalues/comaps) that contain references to other CoValues or with [CoLists](/docs/using-covalues/colists) that contain multiple items. Jazz provides a flexible mechanism for specifying exactly how much of the object graph to load.

### Loading Depth Specifications

Loading depth specifications let you declare exactly which references to load and how deep to go using the `resolve` property:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
class Project extends CoMap {
  name = co.string;
  tasks = co.ref(ListOfTasks);
  owner = co.ref(TeamMember);
}

class Task extends CoMap {
  title = co.string; 
  subtasks = co.ref(ListOfSubtasks);
  assignee = co.optional.ref(TeamMember);
}

// Load just the project, not its references
const project = await Project.load(projectId, { 
  resolve: {} 
});

// Load the project and its tasks
const projectWithTasks = await Project.load(projectId, { 
  resolve: { 
    tasks: true 
  } 
});

// Load the project, its tasks, and their subtasks
const projectDeep = await Project.load(projectId, {
  resolve: {
    tasks: {
      // Load the tasks list and then...
      $each: {
        // For each task in the list, also load its subtasks
        subtasks: true
      }
    }
  }
});

// Load the project, its tasks, and task assignees
const projectWithAssignees = await Project.load(projectId, {
  resolve: {
    tasks: {
      $each: {
        assignee: true
      }
    }
  }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

The depth specification uses the `resolve` property to define which parts of the graph you want to load, making it intuitive to express complex loading patterns.

### Loading Lists

For [CoLists](/docs/using-covalues/colists), Jazz provides a simplified syntax using a boolean value:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
// Load project with all tasks shallowly
const project = await Project.load(projectId, {
  resolve: {
    tasks: true  // Simplified syntax for loading all items in a list
  }
});

// For more complex loading patterns, use $each
const project = await Project.load(projectId, {
  resolve: {
    tasks: {
      $each: {
        subtasks: true,
        assignee: true
      }
    }
  }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

The boolean `true` value is a shorthand that indicates you want to load all items in the list without specifying deeper loading for each item. When you need to load nested properties of list items, use the more explicit `$each` syntax.

## Type Safety with Resolved Type

Jazz provides the `Resolved` type to help you define and enforce the structure of deeply loaded data in your application. This makes it easier to ensure that components receive the data they expect with proper TypeScript validation.

The `Resolved` type is especially useful when passing data between components, as it guarantees that all necessary nested data has been loaded:

<ContentByFramework framework="react">
<CodeGroup>
```ts
// Define a type that includes resolved nested data
type ProjectWithTasks = Resolved<Project, {
  tasks: true
}>;

// Component that expects a fully resolved project
function TaskList({ project }: { project: ProjectWithTasks }) {
  // TypeScript knows tasks are loaded, so this is type-safe
  return (
    <ul>
      {project.tasks.map(task => (
        <li key={task.id}>{task.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

// For more complex resolutions
type FullyLoadedProject = Resolved<Project, {
  tasks: {
    $each: {
      title: true,
      subtasks: true,
      assignee: true
    }
  },
  owner: true
}>;

// Function that requires deeply resolved data
function processProject(project: FullyLoadedProject) {
  // Safe access to all resolved properties
  console.log(`Project ${project.name} owned by ${project.owner.name}`);
  
  project.tasks.forEach(task => {
    console.log(`Task: ${task.title}, Assigned to: ${task.assignee?.name}`);
    console.log(`Subtasks: ${task.subtasks.length}`);
  });
}
```
</CodeGroup>
</ContentByFramework>

<ContentByFramework framework="vanilla">
<CodeGroup>
```ts
// Define a type that includes resolved nested data
type ProjectWithTasks = Resolved<Project, {
  tasks: true
}>;

// Function that expects resolved data
async function taskList({project}: {project: ProjectWithTasks}) {
  // TypeScript knows tasks are loaded, so this is type-safe
  return project.tasks
    .filter(task => task !== null)
    .map(task => task.title)
    .join(`\n - `); 
}

// For more complex resolutions
type FullyLoadedProject = Resolved<Project, {
  tasks: {
    $each: {
      title: true,
      subtasks: true,
      assignee: true
    }
  },
  owner: true
}>;

// Function that requires deeply resolved data
function processProject(project: FullyLoadedProject) {
  // Safe access to all resolved properties
  console.log(`Project ${project.name} owned by ${project.owner.name}`);
  
  project.tasks.forEach(task => {
    console.log(`Task: ${task.title}, Assigned to: ${task.assignee?.name}`);
    console.log(`Subtasks: ${task.subtasks.length}`);
  });
}
```
</CodeGroup>
</ContentByFramework>

Using the `Resolved` type helps catch errors at compile time rather than runtime, ensuring that your components and functions receive data with the proper resolution depth. This is especially useful for larger applications where data is passed between many components.

## Ensuring Data is Loaded

Sometimes you need to make sure data is loaded before proceeding with an operation. The `ensureLoaded` method lets you guarantee that a CoValue and its referenced data are loaded to a specific depth:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
async function completeAllTasks(projectId: ID<Project>) {
  // Ensure the project is loaded
  const project = await Project.load(projectId, { resolve: {} });
  if (!project) return;
  
  // Ensure tasks are loaded
  const loadedProject = await project.ensureLoaded({
    resolve: {
      tasks: true
    }
  });
  
  // Now we can safely access and modify tasks
  loadedProject.tasks.forEach(task => {
    task.status = "completed";
  });
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Performance Considerations

Loading depth is directly related to performance. Loading too much data can slow down your application, while loading too little can lead to unnecessary auto-loading delays. Finding the right balance is crucial for a responsive user experience.

Here are some practical guidelines:

- **Load only what you need** for the current view or operation
- **Preload data** that will be needed soon to improve perceived performance
- Use **caching** to avoid reloading data that hasn't changed
- **Be explicit** about loading patterns in performance-critical code

<CodeGroup>
```ts
// Bad: Loading everything deeply
const project = await Project.load(projectId, {
  resolve: {
    tasks: {
      $each: {
        subtasks: {
          $each: {
            comments: {
              $each: true
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    members: {
      $each: true
    },
    resources: {
      $each: true
    }
  }
});

// Better: Loading only what's needed for the current view
const project = await Project.load(projectId, {
  resolve: {
    tasks: true  // Just load the tasks shallowly
  }
});

// Later, when a task is selected:
const task = await Task.load(selectedTaskId, {
  resolve: {
    subtasks: true  // Now load its subtasks
  }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Using the Load Cache

By default, Jazz maintains a cache of loaded CoValues to avoid unnecessary network requests. This means that if you've already loaded a CoValue, subsequent load requests will use the cached version unless you explicitly request a refresh.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
// First load: fetches from network or local storage
const project = await Project.load(projectId, { resolve: {} });

// Later loads: uses cached version if available
const sameProject = await Project.load(projectId, { resolve: {} });
```
</CodeGroup>



## Best Practices

1. **Be explicit about loading depths**: Always specify exactly what you need
2. **Clean up subscriptions**: Always store and call the unsubscribe function when you're done
3. **Handle all loading states**: Check for undefined (loading), null (not found), and success states
4. **Use framework integrations**: They handle subscription lifecycle automatically
5. **Balance depth and performance**: Load only what you need for the current view
6. **Take advantage of auto-loading**: For simpler use cases, rely on automatic loading of nested references
7. **Use the Resolved type**: Add compile-time type safety for components that require specific resolution patterns

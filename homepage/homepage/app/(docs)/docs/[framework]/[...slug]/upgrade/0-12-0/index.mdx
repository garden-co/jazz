## Summary of Changes

### React Native Changes

- **Split Implementation**: React Native support is now divided into two packages:
  - `jazz-expo`: For Expo applications
  - `jazz-react-native`: For framework-less React Native applications
  - `jazz-react-native-core`: Shared core functionality used by both

- **Storage Adapters**:
  - Expo uses `expo-sqlite` and `expo-secure-store`
  - Framework-less React Native uses `@op-engineering/op-sqlite` and `react-native-mmkv`

- **Import Paths**: You'll need to update imports based on your implementation:
  - From `jazz-react-native` to `jazz-expo` for Expo applications
  - No changes needed for framework-less React Native applications

### Other Frameworks

No breaking changes for React, Vue, or Svelte applications in this version.

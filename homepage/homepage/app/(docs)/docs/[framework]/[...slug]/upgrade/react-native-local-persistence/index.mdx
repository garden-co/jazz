## Overview

Version 0.9.2 introduced local persistence for React Native apps using SQLite, which allows your app data to persist across app restarts.

In version 0.11 and higher, we've separated the React Native implementation into two dedicated packages:

- **jazz-expo**: For Expo applications, using `expo-sqlite` and `expo-secure-store`
- **jazz-react-native**: For framework-less React Native, using `@op-engineering/op-sqlite` and `react-native-mmkv`

Local persistence is now enabled by default in both implementations in version 0.11+.

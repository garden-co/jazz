# Jazz Inspector

[Jazz Inspector](https://inspector.jazz.tools) is a tool to visually inspect a Jazz account or other CoValues.

For now, you can get your account credentials from the `jazz-logged-in-secret` local storage key from within your Jazz app.

## Exporting current account to Inspector from your app

In development mode, you can launch the Inspector from your Jazz app to inspect your account by pressing `Cmd+J`.

## Embedding the Inspector widget into your app

Alternatively, you can embed the Inspector directly into your app, so you don't need to open a separate window.

Install the package.

<CodeGroup>
```sh
npm install jazz-inspector
```
</CodeGroup>

Render the component within your `JazzProvider`.

<CodeGroup>
```sh
import { JazzInspector } from "jazz-inspector";

<JazzProvider> // old
  <JazzInspector />
</JazzProvider> // old
```
</CodeGroup>

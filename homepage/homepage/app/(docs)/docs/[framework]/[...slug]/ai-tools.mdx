# Using AI to build Jazz apps

AI tools, particularly large language models (LLMs), can accelerate your development with Jazz. Searching docs, responding to questions and even helping you write code are all things that LLMs are starting to get good at.

Jazz is a rapidly evolving framework, and the docs are a work in progress, and sometimes AI might get things a little wrong.

To help the LLMs, we provide a number of [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) files that are optimised for use with AI tools.

## Getting started with AI tools

[llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) is a proposal to standardise the way that documentation is provided to AI tools at inference time that helps them understand the context of the code you're writing.

Many AI tools are starting to support this, and we've created a [llms-full.txt](https://jazz.tools/llms-full.txt) file that is optimised for use with AI tools, like Cursor.

## Setting up AI tools

Every AI tool is different, but generally you'll need to either provide the contents of the [llms-full.txt](https://jazz.tools/llms-full.txt) file in your prompt, or upload the file to the tool.

Upload the txt file in your prompt.

### Cursor

1. Go to Settings > Cursor Settings > Features > Docs
2. Click "Add new doc"
3. Enter the following URL:

<CodeGroup>
```
https://jazz.tools/llms-full.txt
```
</CodeGroup>

## Limitations and considerations

AI is amazing, but it's not perfect. What works well this week could break next week (or be twice as good).

We're keen to keep up with changes in tooling to help support you building the best apps, but if you need help from humans (or you have issues getting set up), please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/utDMjHYg42).

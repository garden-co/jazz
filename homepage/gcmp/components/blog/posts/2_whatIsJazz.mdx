When I started building Jazz, I didn’t mean to build a new database. I was radicalized by the new movement of “local-first”, ready to get rid of the entire idea of a backend stack.

This is the story of how I discovered local-first and then slowly de-radicalized myself, re-shaping the ideas I had come across into a what I now call a new database.

## Trigger 1: having to re-invent the data layer for each app

For most of my professional life, I helped companies with full-stack work and product design, often taking whole apps from zero to one.

I always start building apps by defining the data schema. Even before mocking up any UI you typically know what things people will be handling in your app and how they relate to each other.

> Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won't usually need your flowcharts

Everything after that, the stuff between the UI and the data schema “should be” easy. But it isn’t.

What typically follows is an overwhelming puzzle of tech choices and deployment worries just to assemble your stack.

And even if you "just use Postgres for everything" there are so many implementation details to decide. At the most extreme, I've routinely worked with PostGraphile to standardize away as much of the backend as possible

## Trigger 2: a new class of apps raising the bar

I started building Jazz soon after I started using Notion and Figma. It was immediately clear to me…

In the rest of the post, I will lay out different facets of what make Jazz different - roughly in the order I encountered and designed them, and roughly in the order I think they matter to you if you’re curious to learn Jazz.

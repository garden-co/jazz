/** Walkthrough: Defining the data model with CoJSON
 *
 *  Here, we define our main data model of tasks, lists of tasks and projects
 *  using CoJSON's collaborative map and list types, CoMap & CoList.
 *
 *  CoMap values and CoLists items can be:
 *  - arbitrary immutable JSON
 *  - references to other CoValues by their ID
 *    - CoValue IDs (CoIDs) are strings that look like `co_zXPuWmH1D1cKdMpDW6CMzWb3LpY`
 *    - In TypeScript, CoIDs take a generic parameter for the type of the
 *      referenced CoValue, e.g. `CoID<Task>` - to make the references precise

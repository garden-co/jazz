 * Walkthrough: Actions
 *
 * With Jazz is very simple to update the state, you
 * just mutate the values and we take care of triggering
 * the updates and sync  and persist the values you change.
 *
 * We have grouped the complex updates here in an actions file
 * just to keep them separated from the components.
 *
 * Jazz is very unopinionated in this sense and you can adopt the
 * pattern that best fits your app.

# ðŸŽ· Jazz + React Native + Demo Auth

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Inside the Workspace Root

First, install dependencies for the project:

```bash
pnpm i
```

### 2. Inside the `examples/chat-rn` Directory

Next, navigate to the specific example project and run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm pods
pnpm ios
```

This will set up and launch the app on iOS. For Android, you can skip `pnpm pods` and replace the last command with `pnpm android`.

## Creation

```bash
pnpx @react-native-community/cli init chat-rn --version 0.76.7 --install-pods true --skip-git-init true --package-name com.chatrn --directory chat-rn
```

Then change package name in `package.json`, and begin build instructions above.

# Form example with Jazz and React

Live version: [https://form-demo.jazz.tools](https://form-demo.jazz.tools)

This is a simple form example that shows you how to make a form for creating and editing a `CoValue`, 
called `BubbleTeaOrder`, with fields of different types such
as single-select, multi-select, date, text, and boolean.

To create a new `BubbleTeaOrder`, we create an empty order. Because `BubbleTeaOrder` has some
required fields, we can't create an empty `BubbleTeaOrder` directly. 

Instead, we create a `DraftBubbleTeaOrder`,
which has the same structure as `BubbleTeaOrder`, but with all fields set to `optional`.

When the user is ready to submit the order, we treat `DraftBubbleTeaOrder` as a "real order" by
converting it into a `BubbleTeaOrder`.

## Installing & running the example locally

(This requires `pnpm` to be installed, see [https://pnpm.io/installation](https://pnpm.io/installation))

Start by downloading the [jazz repository](https://github.com/garden-co/jazz):
```bash
npx degit gardencmp/jazz jazz
```

Go to the form example directory:
```bash
cd jazz/examples/form
```

Install and build dependencies:
```bash
pnpm i && npx turbo build
```

Start the dev server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Questions / problems / feedback

If you have feedback, let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/utDMjHYg42) or open an issue or PR to fix something that seems wrong.

## Configuration: sync server

By default, the example app uses [Jazz Cloud](https://jazz.tools/cloud) (`wss://cloud.jazz.tools`) - so cross-device use, invites and collaboration should just work.

You can also run a local sync server by running `npx jazz-run sync` and adding the query param `?sync=ws://localhost:4200` to the URL of the example app (for example: `http://localhost:5173/?peer=ws://localhost:4200`), or by setting the `sync` parameter of the `<JazzProvider>` provider component in [./src/main.tsx](./src/main.tsx).

 * @remarks
 * This class provides text-specific optimizations beyond the generic CoList packer:
 *
 * For append operations:
 * - Joins multiple character values into a single string
 * - Significantly reduces JSON overhead for long text sequences
 *
 * For deletion operations:
 * - Stores first deletion + array of OpIDs
 * - Optimizes batch deletions
 *
 * Handles Unicode properly by using grapheme segmentation during unpacking.
 *
 * @example
 * Packing text "Hello":
 * Input: [
 *   { op: "app", value: "H", after: "start" },
 *   { op: "app", value: "e", after: "start" },
 *   { op: "app", value: "l", after: "start" },
 *   { op: "app", value: "l", after: "start" },
 *   { op: "app", value: "o", after: "start" }

   * For compacted deletion operations:
   * - Reconstructs deletion operations from the OpID array

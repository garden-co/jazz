# ðŸŽ· Jazz + React Native

This package provides dedicated support for framework-less React Native applications. It implements storage adapters specifically for React Native's ecosystem (op-sqlite and MMKV) and is designed to work with the Jazz React Native Core package.

Jazz documentation has all of the setup and usage instructions.  Please refer to the [Jazz documentation](https://jazz.dev/docs/react-native) for more information.

For Expo-based applications, please use the `jazz-expo` package instead.
